# Challenge-1
##Challenge 1  Repo Submission

##Intention

I completed this work to further my knowledge in coding and to become more familiar with using the various software applications. While I know I did not execute it fully, I am becoming more familiar with using the terminal (CLI) and Git hub, cloning, and pushing/ppulling my repos. This was quite te challenge for me because there is just so much I do not know. However, I will learn through repitiion.
